# Pokemon Catalog App

Welcome to the Pokemon Catalog App! This web application allows you to browse and filter a list of Pokemon based on their type, color, gender, and text search. It is built using HTML5, vanilla JavaScript, with the help of Webpack for bundling, Bootstrap for styling, LESS for CSS preprocessing, and Watch for automatic compilation during development.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The structure of the app is built using HTML5, providing semantic markup for accessibility and SEO.
- **JavaScript**: The core functionality of the app is implemented in vanilla JavaScript, providing a lightweight and efficient solution.
- **Webpack**: Webpack is used to bundle all JavaScript files into a single bundle for production deployment.
- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is utilized for UI components and styling, allowing for a clean and responsive user interface.
- **LESS**: LESS is used for CSS preprocessing, providing enhanced functionality and organization for styling.
- **Watch**: Watch is used as an observer to automatically compile JavaScript and LESS files during development, streamlining the development process.

## How It Works

The Pokemon Catalog App allows users to filter and browse a list of Pokemon based on various criteria:

- **Filtering**: Users can filter Pokemon by type, color, and gender. The app fetches Pokemon data from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2) and displays them based on the selected filters.
- **Text Search**: Users can search for Pokemon by name or ID using the text search feature. The app dynamically filters the displayed Pokemon based on the search input.
- **Automatic Compilation**: During development, Watch observes changes to JavaScript and LESS files and automatically compiles them, providing a seamless development experience.
